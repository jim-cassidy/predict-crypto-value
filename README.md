Welcome to my tools to help invest.
The goal of my tools is to help people choose more wisely.
Right Now I have 2 charts ( 3 tools ) to assist based on 4 coins so far.

1- Standard Deviation
2- Average Standard Deviation Line
3- Percent Change comparisons of different coins

The server works over the internet.
Right now just ip address.

Server name:
24.228.118.176/5000

 

TODO:
- polish code ( very rough now... )
- document code better
- write github tutorial on standard deviation
- include already programmed AI prediction of current standard deviation value vs. actual
- include multiple time range lookups ( 1 yr. vs 3 mon )
